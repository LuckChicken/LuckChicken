- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luck Chicken a Projec NFT a cockfight multiverse to earn money. Luck chicken has 3 game modes: PvE, Farm and PvP.
Being a multiverse, each game mode will have its own token, each with different tokenomics.
Our PvE is designed to give users a pleasant experience when collecting roosters and trucks to go to fight clubs and win the token in game LuckD $ 
which you can exchange for the native token of the PvE mode: $ Luck. 
This token will be the reward for obtaining the victory in the different fighting clubs, and it will serve us as profit and to improve our team of roosters and 
trucks to be able to go to other clubs with better rewards in LuckD $.
Our Farm is designed to be a calm and relaxing game, with easy mechanics in which you will have to take care of chickens to obtain the $Egg token, which you can use to buy more food and 
close protectors for your small chicken farm and also to exchange it for $LuckFarm which will be a native token 
of our Farm mode. Also, in this game mode you can do breeding, to get PvP fighting cocks or more chickens.
The PvP mode is designed to be an exciting game, full of emotions, and not at all boring, it will be a team battle of 3 roosters vs 3 roosters. 
The winner will be the one who defeats the 3 roosters of his opponent and will obtain as a reward the native token PvP mode: $LuckFight. But, the rewards
are not determined by us, but by you, that's right Â¡BY YOU! Because it will be a gambling game, upon reaching an agreement between the two participants of the fight
of what the amount of the fight will be, the winner takes it all (it should be noted that the house takes 20% of the total of the fights).
